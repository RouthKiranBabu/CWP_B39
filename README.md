# ðŸ‘‰Cypress
  - ## Defination
      Cypress is a modern, open-source JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework designed for web applications. It enables developers and testers to write automated tests to simulate user interactions and verify the functionality of a web application in a real browser environment.
  - ## Key Features
      - **Runs directly in the browser:** Unlike other testing frameworks, Cypress operates within the browser, giving it access to real-time execution and DOM manipulation.
      - **Automatic waiting:** Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions, so you donâ€™t need to add manual waits.
      - **Time travel:** Cypress captures snapshots at each step of the test execution, allowing users to hover over commands to see what happened at each step.
      - **Real-time reloading:** Tests run in real-time as the code changes, offering fast feedback loops.
      - **Easy setup:** Cypress has minimal configuration, making it easy to get started.

# ðŸ‘‰Code Section
  ## Aim
  - Start doing Cypress Project as much as Possible
  - Read Carefully the given documentation and do the Work
  ## Things Required
  - [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
  - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  ## Procedure
  1. Read the [Documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vg_w7W7cWbaoCtJP8Od89vhW4WknQ8QN/edit) Carefully.
  2. Set High and Low Priority Work.
  3. Do the High Priority Work first and then low priority.
  ## Theory
  - Cypress Commands Used
      - [x] `cy.visit()`: Navigates to a URL.
      - [x] `cy.get()`: Finds elements on the page (similar to document.querySelector in JavaScript).
      - [x] `cy.contains()`: Finds an element containing specific text.
      - [x] `cy.click()`: Simulates a click on an element.
      - [ ] `cy.type()`: Types text into an input field.
      - [ ] `cy.url()`: Asserts the current URL.
      - [x] `cy.should()`: Adds an assertion to verify that something should happen (e.g., an element is visible, contains text, etc.).
