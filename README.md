# ðŸ‘‰Cypress
  - ## Defination
      Cypress is a modern, open-source JavaScript-based end-to-end testing framework designed for web applications. It enables developers and testers to write automated tests to simulate user interactions and verify the functionality of a web application in a real browser environment.
  - ## Key Features
      - **Runs directly in the browser:** Unlike other testing frameworks, Cypress operates within the browser, giving it access to real-time execution and DOM manipulation.
      - **Automatic waiting:** Cypress automatically waits for commands and assertions, so you donâ€™t need to add manual waits.
      - **Time travel:** Cypress captures snapshots at each step of the test execution, allowing users to hover over commands to see what happened at each step.
      - **Real-time reloading:** Tests run in real-time as the code changes, offering fast feedback loops.
      - **Easy setup:** Cypress has minimal configuration, making it easy to get started.
